#Description of the DATA

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

#Packages required

No extra packages are required

# Script steps

- Reading all the necessary files by using the read.table function
- Binding the columns from the training and testing files together using cbind
- Concatenating the test and training sets using rbind (end of STEP 1)
- Concatenating all the column names
- Deciding with columns are going to be kept using the grep function on the concatenated names searching for
- mean() OR std() OR subject OR activity_label
- Selecting only the above logic (end of STEP 2)
- Merging the database with the activities names
- Deleting the numeric column of the activity (end of STEP 3)
- Renaming all columns (end of step 4)
- Averaging the data columns using the aggregation function (end of STEP 5)
- Writing the result in a file named "Output.txt" using write.table

#Final Variables created after execution

- finaldata: data set defined by the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- avgdata: data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
